    <p>I’m a self-taught 23 years old Front-End Developer and Designer living near Paris.</p>
    <p>Back in 2009, after graduating from a litterary baccalauréat I learned Plastic Arts <br />at the university Paris 1, Panthéon Sorbonne and then switched to a Graphic Design course at l’Ecole Multimedia.</p>
    <p>Since then, I worked a year as a Front-End Developer and Designer at
    Beautiful Agency while taking a Web Development course at l’Ecole Multimedia that I just successfully graduated from.</p>
    <p>On a daily basis I enjoy writing beautiful and maintanable code mostly in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    but also in PHP, Ruby and Objective-C to build wonderful websites and applications.</p>
    <p>Also when I have the opportunity I like to draw pixel perfect websites and user interfaces.</p>
    <p>At last, in my spare time, as a wannabe artist, I also enjoy taking photographies of people, playing music (DJing and MAO), drawing and painting.</p>
